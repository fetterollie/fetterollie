## Recent Projects

### Using Data Science to Fight Malaria: A Breakthrough in Blood Cell Classification
Data science has the potential to revolutionize the medical field. I demonstrated this by developing an application to swiftly and accurately identify the presence of Malaria in blood cells. This innovative approach enhances the capabilities of doctors and technicians, allowing them to allocate their valuable resources more effectively and ultimately save more lives.

### Streamlining Water Well Maintenance in Tanzania: A Logistic Regression Approach
Access to clean and potable water is a fundamental necessity, yet many regions, including Tanzania, face challenges in providing this essential resource. The IHH Humanitarian Relief Foundation, an NGO dedicated to improving water access, strives to efficiently allocate their maintenance efforts by accurately predicting the functionality of water pumps. By building a classification model, they can optimize their operations, maximize maintenance resources, and ensure clean water is readily available to the people of Tanzania.
